   ...checking mesh resolution
 Mesh resolution:

 ********
 minimum and maximum number of elements
 and points in the CUBIT + SCOTCH mesh:

 NSPEC_global_min =        41160
 NSPEC_global_max =        41160
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =       823200

 NGLOB_global_min =      2693581
 NGLOB_global_max =      2693581
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =     53871620

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.

   ...saving attenuation databases

 Attenuation:
   The code uses a constant Q quality factor, but approximated
   based on a series of Zener standard linear solids (SLS).

   Approximation is performed in the following frequency band:
   Reference frequency requested by the user (Hz):   80.0000000      period (s):   1.25000002E-02

   The following values are computed automatically by the code
   based on the estimated maximum frequency resolution of your mesh
   and can thus vary from what you have requested.

   Frequency band        min/max (Hz):   3.31613111       186.479752    
   Period band           min/max (s) :   5.36251254E-03  0.301556230    
   Logarithmic central frequency (Hz):   24.8674736      period (s):   4.02131714E-02
